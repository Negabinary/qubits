Read the guide at https://negabinary.github.io/qubits/

Minecraft version: 1.14.4 (I think it only works on forge 28.1.110, and not later, so go [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.14.4.html) and look through all versions at the bottom).

If you're downloading this you could be the first, so expect bugs!
